# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 
-It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) The development of programming languages
b) The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
c) The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Requirements-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
b) Design-Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
c) Implementation-Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
d) Testing-Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
e) Deployment-Releasing the software to users or customers
f) Maintenance-Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile methodology is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) Software developer-writes code and implements software solutions
b) Quality Assurance Engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
c) Project Manager-oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g., Visual Studio Code 
VCS track changes to source code and coordinates work among team members e.g., Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) Requirements changes during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
